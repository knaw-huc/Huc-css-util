## Introduction
This framework is build for developers of the HuC Digital Infrastructure Teams. It is build on following directives:
* Unburden HuC developers with design decisions and responsive behaviour;
* Create a default well designed webpage or tool;
* Keep our tools consistent and recognizable as HuC tools.

## Core
Add the following link tag to the `<head>` of your HTML page:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://huc-css-util.netlify.com/css/huc-css.css">`

If your'e building a tool for the Huc, one of the inhousing institutes or Clariah you can use branded css files: `huc-css-huc.css`, `huc-css-huygens.css`, `huc-css-meertens.css`, `huc-css-iisg.css` or `huc-css-clariah.css`

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://huc-css-util.netlify.com/css/huc-css-huc.css">`

With this stylesheet the site will use basic Roboto font in 17 pixels.
